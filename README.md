# Weather App

"!Important example_code folder contains APKs for Android only to install and also Android and iOS working demo videos."

I have used the free open-source 'https://open-meteo.com/' weather API to get weather updates based on user location. I have also added some other features, which are as follows:.
* Location selection using Google.
* User settings to convert temperature units.
* User settings to show full-length forecast.

## Configuration
* Dart 2.19.1
* Flutter sdk 3.7.1

## Important Libraries
* Dio - network call
* Providers - state management
* FontAwesome - attractive icons
* Gelocation - user location and places

## Works Well 
* Android
* IOS

Happy Coding.
